== New and updated guides since the previous release
As Open Liberty features and functionality continue to grow, we continue to add link:https://openliberty.io/guides/?search=new&key=tag[new guides to openliberty.io] on those topics to make their adoption as easy as possible.  Existing guides also receive updates in order to address any reported bugs/issues, keep their content current, and expand what their topic covers.

// In the following section, list any new guides, or changes/updates to existing guides.  
// The following is an example of how the list can be structured (similar to the bugs section):
